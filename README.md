About this group
================

I created this group because there did not seem to be a centralized place to peruse all of the open-source projects out there relating to DigitalOcean. Hopefully, this DigitalOcean-GitHub organization can lead to more collaboration.

### Membership

***DigitalOcean User Projects*** will strive to be a community-run organization; and everyone is invited to join, contribute & provide feedback.

#### Joining

If you'd like to become a member (create a free, [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free) &ndash; if you don't already have one &ndash; and), submit a request via GitHub's [Issues](https://github.com/DigitalOcean-User-Projects/about/issues) ticketing system.  For more information on Issues, check out [Issues 2.0: The Next Generation](https://github.com/blog/831-issues-2-0-the-next-generation).

#### Listing Your Project

If you'd like your project listed, submit a request via GitHub's [Issues](https://github.com/DigitalOcean-User-Projects/about/issues) ticketing system; and I can either:

* fork your repo; or
* assign you admin privileges if you transfer ownership of your project to **DigitalOcean-User-Projects**.

_I only recently started learning how to use GitHub, let alone Git_. _So, let me know if there's a more efficient way to handle this_.
