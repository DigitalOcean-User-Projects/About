About this group
================

I created this group because there did not seem to be a centralized place to peruse all of the open-source projects out there relating to DigitalOcean. Hopefully, this GitHub org can lead to more collaboration.

### Membership

***DigitalOcean User Projects*** will strive to be a community-run organization; and everyone is invited to join, contribute & provide feedback.

#### Joining

If you'd like to become a member, submit a request via GitHub's [Issues](https://github.com/DigitalOcean-User-Projects/about/issues) ticketing system.
